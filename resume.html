            <h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
<p>
  <h4>HCL Technologies, America (May, 2017 - Current)<span style="float:right;">Cary, North Carolina</span></h4>
  <i>Innovation Lab Intern (Software Engineering)</i>
  <ul>
  <li>Built an intelligent data synthesis application, using ANTLR in Java, which can recognise regular expressions to generate a rich and extensive data set.
  <li>Constructed a DevOps practice for the team by setting up Jenkins for continuous delivery using Ansible, which streamlined code delivery and increased overall productivity.
  <li>Devised a strategy to integrate multiple cross-platform projects, with varied dependencies and endpoints, into a single project with capability of running on a single port upon deployment to a remote IBM WebSphere server.
  <li>Enhanced the UI of application by designing various reusable components in Angular 4, which can be easily customised and integrated with other existing UI components as well as external REST APIs.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Accenture Services, India (Nov 2013 - July 2016)<span style="float:right;">Mumbai, India</span></h4>
  <i>Software Engineer Analyst</i>
  <ul>
  <li>Constructed multi-threaded batch procedures using Spring Batch for quickly processing voluminous financial data, stored in relational databases, and generating reports that are streamed using web services.
  <li>Refined a core data processing OSGI module that managed enormous amount of disparate data for an e-commerce application (built using Adobe Experience Manager), with resulting changes resolving all existing bugs and improving application health.
  <li>Designed configurable UI components in Adobe Experience Manager, using JavaScript that can be changed dynamically by an authorized person on a production environment.
  <li>Piloted use of testing frameworks like Junit and Mockito combined with code analysis tools like Sonar that paved way for best practices and improved quality of code.
</ul>
</p>

  <h3><u>Technical Projects</u></h3>
<p>
  <h4>AI assistant for Lexis Advance, Lexis Nexis Hackathon (JavaScript)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Built an interactive chat bot using NLP that can help find relevant information across multiple pages and
    data store of Lexis Advance System, by leveraging power of Node.js, Microsoft Bot Framework and Azure Services.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Cluster Monitoring and Auto-recovery Agent (JavaScript)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Created an agent which monitors traffic from Nginx load balancer to clusters of AWS nodes hosting micro-services, the logs of which are parsed and saved on an Elastic Stash.
  <li>On discovery of under-performing node/s, agent will stop all the traffic to that node/s, notify system admin and try to recover the node/s by performing predefined tasks.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>The Natural Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring System (Python)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Employed machine learning to monitor fishing techniques and identify any illegal activities.
    The inputs were from cameras installed on boats, which are processed using convolution neural networks, using Keras and Tensorflow, to accurately classify fishes.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Automated Robust Continuous Deployment (Ansible)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Devised Ansible roles that can create and provision remote virtual machines hosted on AWS,
    capable of running Jenkins CI jobs and subsequently trigger intelligent deployment to a Nomad cluster,
    that is fault tolerant with ability to rollback in case of any failure.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Flight Reservation Portal (Java)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Crafted a highly scalable flight reservation system using Akka server and powered by  Play Framework,
    that provided RESTful services for concurrent flight booking reservations generated through a custom Android application or other external portals.
  </ul>
