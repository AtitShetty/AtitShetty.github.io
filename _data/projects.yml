      description: |
        <li> Devised Ansible roles that can create and provision remote virtual machines hosted on AWS, capable of running Jenkins CI jobs and subsequently trigger intelligent deployment to a Nomad cluster, that is fault tolerant with ability to rollback in case of any failure.</li>
        <li> Created a robust rolling update strategy for sending updates to all the nodes in AWS, that updates only few nodes at a time.</li>
        <li> Built a canary release strategy using Node.js and Redis Server that will publish and manage new experimental features to production environments.</li>
      languages: JavaScript
      technologies: Ansible, Node.js, Jenkins, AWS, Redis

    - name: Cluster Monitoring and Auto-recovery Agent
      link: https://github.com/AtitShetty/DevOps-Cluster-Monitoring-Agent
      description: |
        <li> Created an agent which monitors traffic from Nginx load balancer to clusters of AWS nodes hosting micro-services, the logs of which are parsed and saved on an Elastic Stack.</li>
        <li> On discovery of under-performing node/s, agent will stop all the traffic to that node/s, notify system admin and try to recover the node/s by performing predefined actions based on type of problem.</li>

    - name: Peer-To-Multi-Peer File Transfer System
      link: https://github.com/AtitShetty/p2mp-ftp
      description: |
        <li> A simple java application that uses UDP protocol for fast transfer of a file to multiple peers from one peer.</li>
        <li> A peer advertises a list of files it has available in its repository to all the peers in its list.</li>
        <li> Any peer that needs a particular will send the request to this peer, which on receipt of response from all peers proceeds to transfer the file to all the requesters.</li>
        <li> If a file has not been transferred, it will try again till file transfer is successful, this achieving reliability on UDP.</li>
