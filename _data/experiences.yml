    <li>This was the beginning of my professional experience as a software developer.<li>
    <li>I worked on multiple e-commerce projects, primarily on creating multi-threaded and concurrent APIs for managing high volume data transactions.
    I used frameworks like Spring Batch, JAXB, OSGI, etc. to parse, process, store and report voluminous data generated by e-commerce website.</li>
    <li>Apart from backend I have worked on frontend in designing UI components and integrating them with backend services.</li>
    <li>One of the highlights was the use of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
    It is a content management system that helps to design highly configurable web pages and has great support for analytics.
    I designed OSGI modules for processing data from SAP Hybris external API, authentication and web components that were integrated with AEM.</li>
