      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Where are you from?<br/>
      I am from India, born in the countryside district of Udupi and brought up in the hustle and bustle of financial capital, Mumbai.</p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> What about your education?<br/>
        After completing my primary education, I decided to pursue Bachelors of Engineering in Electronics from University of Mumbai.
      </p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Tell us about your interest in software development?<br/>
        I developed a great interest in programming embedded systems and robotics.
        This eventually led me to develop applications in high-level programming languages as well as web design.
        I eventually knew what I had to do after graduation.
      </p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> So what did you do after graduation?<br/>
      Well I joined Accenture as a Software Developer. There I was able to work with very smart people, in very cool projects.
      I was able to work across diverse domains from backend to web design, from databases and concurrent programming to DevOps.
      I was able to understand how to make enterprise level applications and importance of being a team player.
      </p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Why did you leave?<br/>
        I decided that it was time for me to widen my horizon and return to academia. I got enrolled for MS in Computer Networking at North Carolina State University, USA in August, 2016.
      </p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> So, what are you upto nowadays?<br/>
        After a lot of assignments and tests, I am in my final semester of graduate studies and will be graduating in May, 2018. I am also doing a Co-op at Innovation Lab in HCL Technologies, Cary as a software engineering intern.
      </p>
      <p><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Wow looks like a busy schedule! What do you do in your free time?<br/>
        Currently, I am taking a beginners Karate class, learning how to swim and playing guitar. However, you can find me usually reading a book or doing some research. I am partial towards acting and love watching movies.
